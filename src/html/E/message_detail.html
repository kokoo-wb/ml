        <p>In the 80s, the hair accessory was invaluable. Almost every style involved some sort of hair accessory or embellishment to really set it off. Today, the hair accessory is not a part of everyday style and care should be taken as to when and how
            to use the hair accessory so that you will not look dated.</p>
        <p>With that said, there are some occasions that scream for hair accessories: Work, social occasions and formal events may all have you searching for the perfect hair accessory to set off your look. While different occasions will call for different
            hair accessories, a good rule of thumb to follow is to choose the sedate hair accessory over one that could not go unnoticed in a crowd of a few hundred or a few thousand.</p>

        <img src="../../images/pic1.png" />

        <p>While choosing the right one can be tricky, there are a few pointers that you can follow to help you pick the perfect hair accessories to complete your look. Here are just a few</p>
        <p>Work. In many work situations, you will likely have to wear your hair up. No matter if your type of employment requires it or you simply like to change your look now and then, wearing your hair up calls for the right hair accessory to do the job.
            The number one rule to finding the right hair accessory for work is to avoid banana clips at all costs. I mean, who still makes these things? Apparently they’re making money at it or they wouldn’t still be producing these torture devices of
            the 80s. Don’t further their cause: stop buying this hair accessory. The second rule is to choose hair accessories that closely match your hair color or that blend nicely with it. Matching a hair accessory to your clothes is only cute when
            you are 5-years-old. What you choose will depend largely on your length of hair and how you like to wear your hair up. For French twists, choose hair accessories that resemble over-sized hair clips. Simply twist and clip.</p>
